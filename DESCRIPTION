Description: BlackSheep is a tool designed for outlier analysis in the context 
    of pairwise comparisons in an effort to find distinguishing characteristics 
    from two groups. This tool was designed to be applied for biological 
    applications such as phosphoproteomics or transcriptomics, but it can be 
    used for any data that can be represented by a 2D table, and has two sub 
    populations within the table to compare.
